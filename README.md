# [ORONAPI] CRUD Restful API for Social Media App Built With Java - Spring Boot - Hibernate - MySQL

## Introduction

Here is my source code for building Restful API of a social media app for users who want to share their redundant food or something, and then others can register to receive those things.

## Motivation

 In Vietnam's daily life, I realized that there are many households with excess food that is not used up. Meanwhile, some people need that amount of food for their living, to make pet food for example. Moreover, it is the demand to give and take old things together. From that actual need, I decided to build a social media app dedicated to sharing utensils (food, items, ..) to make this sharing more efficient and convenient and called the application as ORON (Our Redundances Other Necessaries).
