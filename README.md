## Motivation

 In Vietnam daily life, I realized that there are many households with excess food that is not used up. Meanwhile, some people need that amount of food for their living, to make pet food for example. Moreover it is the demand to give and take old things together. From that actual need, I decided to build a social media app dedicated to sharing utensils (food, items, ..) to make this sharing more efficient and convenient  and called the application as ORON (Our Redundances Other Necessaries).
